# Summary
This weather app was built using Java and JavaFX. A search bar is used to change the selected location. It displays weather variables such as the current temperature, humidity, dew point, precipitation, visibility, and wind speed. It also includes a fahrenheit/celsius button meant for toggling the temperature unit. Imperial and Metrics buttons are also included, and meant for toggling the measurement system used in the weather data.

# Tips
It is recommended to specify the place. For example, instead of inputting only "Miami", it would be better to use "Miami FL".
